//! Animation intents — the runtime's carrier for the declared, decided
//! `.animate`/`.transition`/`.effect` DSL modifiers (docs/dev/dsl/modifiers.md
//! "Motion", docs/dev/ui/foundations/animation.md).
//!
//! An intent is a PURE, value-typed description stamped onto an animated node
//! at emit time: which motion token, which category, and — for
//! `.animate`/`.effect` — the current committed snapshot of the driving
//! value/trigger expression. It carries NO clock and NO physics: the DSL stays
//! pure (principles.md §4) and the HOST (app-host `AnimationDriver`) owns time,
//! interpolation, and paint. The intent is resolved to a scene `node_id` after
//! emit (`View::animations`, via the same pre-order `path_to_box_id` walk the
//! interaction handlers use).

/// Which motion modifier produced this intent.

# Project Layout Overview

The repository is structured to keep low-level kernel code, userspace
libraries, developer tooling, and infrastructure recipes clearly separated.
This page explains **why** each top-level directory exists and what you can
expect to find there when hacking on the Open Nexus operating system.

## `kernel/`
Core NEURON kernel crates. The `neuron` library contains architecture and
platform code compiled with `#![no_std]`, while `neuron-boot` is the freestanding
binary that firmware jumps into. There is no kernel-side Interface Definition
Language (IDL) parsingâ€”only runtime-safe boot and core services live here.

## `source/`
Processes that run as OS services or applications. Daemons live in
`source/services/*d` and remain intentionally thin: they translate IPC messages
into calls to the userspace domain libraries, keeping policy and business logic
out of privileged processes.

## `userspace/`
Host-first libraries that model domains and protocols. These crates compile
with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, are friendly to tools such as Miri, and serve as
the single source of truth for shared business logic across the platform.

## `tools/`
Developer productivity tooling including generators (such as `nexus-idl`),
linters, and other host utilities. Generators live here instead of inside the
kernel tree so they can depend on `std` and integrate with the build system
without polluting runtime crates.

## `recipes/`
Reproducible build and developer environment recipes. Use these scripts to
bootstrap toolchains, set up host dependencies, or spin up deterministic
container images for specific workflows.

## `podman/`
Container definitions that mirror the continuous integration environment. Build
these images locally to ensure the same compiler and system packages as the CI
pipeline.

## `config/`
Shared configuration for linting and quality gates (e.g. `clippy.toml`,
`rustfmt.toml`, `cargo-deny`). Centralizing policies keeps workspace crates in
sync and ensures reproducible builds.

## `scripts/`
Helper scripts for building, running, and testing the system. This includes the
QEMU runners, log trimming helpers, and automation wrappers for self-tests and
toolchain setup.

## `docs/`
All project documentation: high-level overviews, testing guides, architecture
notes, and RFCs. Start here when you need a conceptual map of the system or to
learn the expected engineering workflows.

## How to Navigate the Repository

- **Kernel changes:** begin in `kernel/`, updating `neuron` for core logic and
  `neuron-boot` for the entry binary. Keep cross-cutting helpers in userspace
  libraries when possible.
- **Service or daemon updates:** read the relevant module under
  `source/services/` and locate the shared library under `userspace/` that owns
  the business rules before touching the daemon adapter.
- **Library or API evolution:** update the crate in `userspace/`, extend its
  property and contract tests, and regenerate any tooling outputs via `tools/`.
- **Environment and tooling adjustments:** check `recipes/`, `podman/`, and
  `scripts/` for the existing automation before adding new scripts.

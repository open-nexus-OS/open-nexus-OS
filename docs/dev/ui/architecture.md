# UI Architecture

This document provides a high-level architecture map of the UI stack:

- windowing (`windowd`) + compositor,
- renderer abstraction,
- layout + runtime,
- input routing + a11y semantics,
- SystemUI and app shell.

This page is intentionally concise and links to deeper docs as they land.

# Settings (UI)

Settings pages are built using the same design system and should remain consistent across device profiles.

Guidance:

- keep pages shallow and searchable,
- prefer inline previews (where safe),
- avoid deep modal stacks,
- keep the UI usable on both tablet and desktop.

## Themes (bounded customization)

We prefer **few high-quality presets** over fully free-form theming.

- Presets + semantic tokens: `docs/dev/ui/colors.md`
- Theme authoring: `docs/dev/ui/theme.md`

# ADR-0015: Resource Manager Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The resource manager provides localized asset allocation and management for Open Nexus OS. It handles resource allocation, deallocation, and resource lifecycle management.

## Decision
Implement a resource manager with the following architecture:

### Core Components
- **Resource Allocation**: Localized asset allocation and management
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for resource operations
- **Lifecycle Management**: Resource allocation and deallocation
- **Asset Tracking**: Resource usage and availability tracking

### Resource Management Features
- **Asset Allocation**: Allocate localized assets and resources
- **CLI Commands**: Help and resource management commands
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Resource allocation and deallocation
- **Usage Monitoring**: Resource usage and availability

### Implementation Status
- **Current**: Functional CLI interface with resource initialization
- **Future**: Enhanced resource allocation and tracking
- **Dependencies**: Resource tracking, allocation algorithms

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Effective resource management system
- **Positive**: CLI interface for resource operations
- **Negative**: Basic implementation with limited features
- **Negative**: Requires resource tracking integration

## Implementation Notes
- CLI provides help and resource management commands
- Resource allocation and deallocation
- Asset tracking and availability monitoring
- Integration with resource allocation algorithms

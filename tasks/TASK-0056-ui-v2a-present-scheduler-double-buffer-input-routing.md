## Context

UI v1 brought up a minimal compositor and surface protocol. UI v2 introduces the first “real-time UX” aspects:

- double buffering (no tearing),
- a present scheduler aligned to vsync,
- input routing with hit-testing and focus.

This task is deliberately **render-backend agnostic**:

- CPU backend is used for v2a proofs.
- A future GPU backend (Imagination/PowerVR or virtio-gpu) can plug into the same interfaces once the
  device-class service stack is available (see `TRACK-DRIVERS-ACCELERATORS`).

Scope note:

- A focused “Windowing/Compositor v2” integration slice (damage regions, input regions hit-testing, deterministic screencaps/thumbs, WM-lite + alt-tab) is tracked separately as `TASK-0199`/`TASK-0200` to avoid stretching v2a into WM/screencap territory.
- If early QEMU fluidity work needs tighter click-to-frame latency, event coalescing, and no-damage short-circuit rules,
  use `TASK-0056C` rather than expanding the v2a functional baseline indefinitely.

## Goal

Deliver:

1. **Double-buffered surfaces**:
   - client acquires a back buffer VMO, writes into it, then presents by frame index.
2. **Present scheduler** in `windowd`:
   - vsync-aligned present,
   - coalescing of rapid submits,
   - bounded fences and deterministic markers,
   - basic latency metrics (internal counters; log markers are enough for v2a).
3. **Input routing**:
   - hit-testing through the layer tree,
   - focus model (focus follows click),
   - pointer and keyboard delivery to surfaces.
4. Host tests for present scheduling + input routing, and OS markers for QEMU.

## Non-Goals

- Kernel changes.
- Text shaping and SVG (v2b).
- Real HW vsync; v2 uses a timer-driven vsync spine.
- Low-level input device drivers (HID/touch) or input event pipeline (handled by `TASK-0252`/`TASK-0253`; this task focuses on input routing within windowd).

## Constraints / invariants (hard requirements)

- No `unwrap/expect`; no blanket `allow(dead_code)`.
- Bounded scheduler state:
  - cap queue depth per surface,
  - cap coalesced damage rect count.
- Premultiplied alpha rules must be consistent across present/composition.
- No parallel sync model: fences must be versioned and minimal (documented as v2a semantics).
- No sidecar compositor/input authority; v2a extends the existing `windowd` state machine.
- Marker honesty is mandatory: no `ok/ready` marker before corresponding present/input state transitions are real.

## Security / authority invariants

- `windowd` remains single authority for scene ownership, present sequencing, hit-test, and focus transitions.
- Input/focus routing rejects unauthorized or stale surface references deterministically.
- Queue/fence/input event handling stays bounded to avoid DoS-style unbounded growth.
- Logs/markers expose bounded metadata only (ids/counts/seq), never raw frame/input payload dumps.

## Red flags / decision points

- **YELLOW (fence semantics)**:
  - v2a “present fence” can be a minimal event signaled after composition tick.
  - Must be documented as minimal and not yet suitable for true low-latency pipelines.
- **YELLOW (CPU-only wording)**:
  - We do not lock ourselves into CPU-only. Interfaces must not assume CPU blits.
  - But v2a proofs remain CPU-based to keep the task QEMU-tolerant.
- **YELLOW (authority drift)**:
  - introducing a parallel present/input routing lane in launcher/SystemUI or selftest would invalidate v1/v1d carry-in assumptions.
- **YELLOW (fake-green marker risk)**:
  - marker ladders can go green while focus/hit-test/fence semantics are wrong unless host assertions check actual routing outcomes.
- **YELLOW (scope creep)**:
  - avoid absorbing visible cursor polish (`TASK-0056B`), perf tuning (`TASK-0056C`), or WM/compositor-v2 breadth (`TASK-0199`/`TASK-0200`) into the v2a baseline.

Red-flag mitigation now:

- Keep one `windowd` authority path for present scheduler and input routing.
- Gate success markers on post-state evidence (`present ack`, focused surface id, deterministic click path) plus host assertions.
- Treat cursor visuals, click-latency tuning, and WM-lite breadth as explicit follow-ups.
- Keep kernel untouched and consume existing carry-in floor from 55/55B/55C.

## Gate E quality mapping (TRACK alignment)

`TASK-0056` contributes to Gate E (`Windowing, UI & Graphics`, `production-floor`) in
`tasks/TRACK-PRODUCTION-GATES-KERNEL-SERVICES.md` by extending 55C from visible first-frame proof into
deterministic present scheduling and input-routing correctness.

- **first-frame/present/input path:** v2a owns deterministic scheduler + focus/hit-test baseline.
- **surface ownership/reuse:** must preserve 55/55C ownership boundaries; no sidecar authority.
- **perf closure:** intentionally not claimed here; measured optimization follows in `TASK-0056C`.

## Stop conditions (Definition of Done)

### Proof (Host) — required

`tests/ui_v2a_host/`:

- present scheduler:
  - client produces N frames rapidly → scheduler coalesces and presents fewer times deterministically
  - fences are signaled after present
  - “no damage → no present”
- input routing:
  - two overlapping surfaces → pointer hit-test selects the topmost visible surface
  - focus transitions on click and keyboard delivery goes to focused surface

### Proof (OS/QEMU) — gated

UART markers (order tolerant):

- `windowd: present scheduler on`
- `windowd: input on`
- `windowd: focus -> <surface_id>`
- `launcher: click ok`
- `SELFTEST: ui v2 present ok`
- `SELFTEST: ui v2 input ok`

### Quality gates (must be green for closure)

- `scripts/fmt-clippy-deny.sh`
- `just test-all`
- `just ci-network`
- `make clean`, `make build`, `make test`, `make run` (in order)

## Touched paths (allowlist)

- `source/services/windowd/` + `source/services/windowd/idl/` (extend)
- `userspace/apps/launcher/` (update to double-buffer and input click demo)
- `tests/ui_v2a_host/` (new)
- `source/apps/selftest-client/` (markers)
- `tools/postflight-ui-v2a.sh` (delegating)
- `docs/dev/ui/input/input.md` + `docs/dev/ui/foundations/rendering/renderer.md` (new/extend)

## Plan (small PRs)

1. **IDL updates**
   - Add `AcquireBackBuffer()` + `Present(frame_idx, damage, fence)`
   - Extend `input.capnp` with pointer/keyboard events

2. **Present scheduler**
   - per-surface double buffer state
   - vsync tick alignment
   - damage coalescing rules documented
   - markers:
     - `windowd: present scheduler on`
     - `windowd: present (seq=... frames=coalesced|single latency_ms=...)`

3. **Input routing**
   - hit-test on layer tree
   - focus manager + delivery channels
   - markers:
     - `windowd: input on`
     - `windowd: focus -> ...`
     - `windowd: pointer hit ...`

4. **Launcher update**
   - double-buffer API
   - click toggles a highlight rectangle → `launcher: click ok`

5. **Proof + docs**
   - host tests + OS markers + docs

# Cursor AI Rules for Open-Nexus-OS Project
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file contains rules and restrictions for AI assistance in this project.
# These rules help maintain project integrity and prevent unintended changes.
#
# ==============================================================================

# PROTECTED FILES AND DIRECTORIES
# ==============================================================================
# The following files and directories are PROTECTED and should NEVER be modified
# without explicit user consent:

PROTECTED_ITEMS:
  - "scripts/" directory and ALL contents
  - "Makefile" (root level)
  - "config/" directory and ALL contents
  - "redox/" directory and ALL contents
  - "recipes/gui/nexus-assets/" directory and ALL contents
  - "recipes/libs/libnexus/" directory and ALL contents

# RULES FOR PROTECTED ITEMS:
# ==============================================================================
# 1. NEVER modify files in the scripts/ directory
# 2. NEVER modify the root Makefile
# 3. NEVER modify files in config/ directory
# 4. NEVER modify files in redox/ directory
# 5. NEVER modify files in recipes/gui/nexus-assets/ directory
# 6. NEVER modify files in recipes/libs/libnexus/ directory
# 7. If changes to these items are needed, ALWAYS ask for explicit user consent first
# 8. Explain WHY the change is needed and WHAT the impact will be
# 9. Wait for explicit "yes" or "proceed" confirmation before making any changes
# 10. READING from protected directories is allowed for analysis purposes

# SAFE TO MODIFY:
# ==============================================================================
# The following directories are safe to modify without explicit consent:
# - recipes/gui/nexus-*/source/src/ (application source code)
# - Any .md files (documentation)
# - Any .toml files in recipes/ (recipe configurations)

# CAUTION ZONE - MODIFY WITH DEEP THINKING:
# ==============================================================================
# The following directories require EXTREME CAUTION and deep analysis:
# - recipes/gui/nexus/ (core window manager - changes can break entire system)
#   * Only modify after deep thinking about system-wide impact
#   * Consider how changes affect all GUI applications
#   * Test thoroughly as this is the foundation of the entire GUI system
#   * Ask for confirmation before making significant changes

# BUILD AND RUN COMMANDS:
# ==============================================================================
# Standard commands for this project:
# - Build: "cd ~/open-nexus-OS && make build"
# - Run: "cd ~/open-nexus-OS && make run"
# - Debug output: "cd ~/open-nexus-OS && make run 2>&1 | grep 'DEBUG:'"
# - Test mode: "cd ~/open-nexus-OS && make run test"
#
# The build process:
# 1. Updates Redox repository (git pull)
# 2. Copies custom recipes from recipes/ to redox/cookbook/recipes/
# 3. Copies config from config/ to redox/config/x86_64/
# 4. Builds Redox with custom configuration
# 5. Creates harddrive.img with all packages
#
# The run process:
# 1. Launches QEMU with the built harddrive.img
# 2. Starts Redox OS with Nexus GUI applications
# 3. Debug output appears at runtime, not during build

# SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
# ==============================================================================
# - Always test changes with "make build" before considering them complete
# - If build fails, fix the issue rather than reverting changes
# - Provide clear explanations of what was changed and why
# - Ask for confirmation before making large architectural changes
# - Use absolute paths (~/open-nexus-OS) for commands to work on any system

# EMERGENCY OVERRIDE:
# ==============================================================================
# If the user explicitly states "override rules" or "ignore protection",
# then proceed with caution and document the override clearly.

# ==============================================================================
# End of Rules
# ==============================================================================
